Feature: User Story 4

  Scenario: As the system owner, I want to provide an API that creates a working class hero with vouchers.
  AC1: POST request /api/v1/hero/vouchers
  AC4: Vouchers are created in table VOUCHERS

    Given I delete voucher record with natid 'natid-41'
    And I delete working class hero record with natid 'natid-41'
    When I add working hero with 'wchs-userstory4-ac1-1.json' file by calling '/api/v1/hero/vouchers' endpoint
    Then System should return '200' response code
    When I add working hero with 'wchs-userstory4-ac1-2.json' file by calling '/api/v1/hero/vouchers' endpoint
    Then System should return '400' response code
    And System should return 'errorMsg' as 'Working Class Hero of natid: natid-41 already exists!'
    And the working class heros table should be expected based on natid 'natid-41'
      | natid    | name         | gender | birth_date          | death_date | brownie_points | salary | tax_paid |
      | natid-41 | Voucher Test | MALE   | 2000-04-08T00:00:00 | null       | 1              | 10.0   | 1.0      |
    And the vouchers table should be expected based on natid 'nat-41'

  Scenario Outline: As the system owner, I want to provide an API that creates a working class hero with vouchers. (Positive flow)
  AC2: Field validation are the same as User Story 1

    Given I delete voucher record with natid '<natid>'
    And I delete working class hero record with natid '<natid>'
    When I add working hero with '<fileName>' file by calling '/api/v1/hero/vouchers' endpoint
    Then System should return '200' response code
    And the working class heros table should be expected based on natid '<natid>'
      | natid   | name   | gender   | birth_date   | death_date   | brownie_points   | salary   | tax_paid   |
      | <natid> | <name> | <gender> | <birth_date> | <death_date> | <brownie_points> | <salary> | <tax_paid> |
    And the vouchers table should be expected based on natid '<natid>'
      | VOUCHER 1 | TRAVEL |

    Examples:
      | fileName                   | natid    | name                                                                                                 | gender | birth_date          | death_date      | brownie_points | salary  | tax_paid |

  Scenario Outline: As the system owner, I want to provide an API that creates a working class hero with vouchers. (Negative flow)
  AC2: Field validation are the same as User Story 1
  AC3: If vouchers is null or empty, the working class hero cannot be created
  AC5: If any validation fails, nothing is persisted.

    Given I delete voucher record with natid '<natid>'
    And I delete working class hero record with natid '<natid>'
    When I add working hero with '<fileName>' file by calling '/api/v1/hero/vouchers' endpoint
    Then System should return '400' response code
    And System should return 'errorMsg' as '<errorMsg>'
    And the working class heros table should be expected based on natid '<natid>'
      | null | null | null | null | null | null | null | null |
    And the vouchers table should be expected based on natid '<natid>'
      | null | null |
