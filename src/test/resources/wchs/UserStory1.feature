Feature: User Story 1

  @US1_AC1 @US1_AC3 @US1_AC4
  Scenario: Application allows the creation of a single working class hero via API call.
  AC1: POST request /api/v1/hero
  AC3: If the natid already exists in the database, return error status code 400. No changes
  should be made to the existing record.
  AC4: Verify record is created in database table WORKING_CLASS_HEROES

    Given I delete working class hero record with natid 'natid-12'
    When I add working hero with 'wchs-userstory1-ac1-1.json' file by calling '/api/v1/hero' endpoint
    Then System should return '200' response code
    When I add working hero with 'wchs-userstory1-ac1-2.json' file by calling '/api/v1/hero' endpoint
    Then System should return '400' response code
    And System should return 'errorMsg' as 'Working Class Hero of natid: natid-12 already exists!'
    And the working class heros table should be expected based on natid 'natid-12'
      | natid    | name     | gender | birth_date          | death_date | brownie_points | salary | tax_paid |
      | natid-12 | API test | MALE   | 2000-04-08T00:00:00 | null       | 1              | 10.0   | 1.0      |

  Scenario Outline: Application allows the creation of a single working class hero via API call. (Positive flow)
  AC2: Field validations are as follow
  1. natid must be in the format “natid-number”, where number is between 0 to 9999999
  (inclusive)
  2. name must contain letters and spaces with a length between 1 and 100 (inclusive)
  3. gender must be either MALE or FEMALE
  4. birthDate format is in yyyy-mm-dd’T’HH:mm:ss and cannot be a future date. ‘T’ is a
  literal string and the time is in HH:mm:ss
  5. deathDate format is in yyyy-mm-dd’T’HH:mm:ss
  6. salary is a decimal and cannot be negative
  7. taxPaid is a decimal and cannot be negative
  8. browniePoints and deathDate are nullable

    Given I delete working class hero record with natid '<natid>'
    When I add working hero with '<fileName>' file by calling '/api/v1/hero' endpoint
    Then System should return '200' response code
    And the working class heros table should be expected based on natid '<natid>'
      | natid   | name   | gender   | birth_date   | death_date   | brownie_points   | salary   | tax_paid   |
      | <natid> | <name> | <gender> | <birth_date> | <death_date> | <brownie_points> | <salary> | <tax_paid> |

    Examples:
      | fileName                   | natid    | name                                                                                                 | gender | birth_date          | death_date      | brownie_points | salary  | tax_paid |
